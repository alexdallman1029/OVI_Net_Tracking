# OVI_Net_Tracking
A trip with OVI, an institute dedicated to picking up ghost nets in the Pacific Gyre, on SV Machais to drop tracking devices on nets found. The purpose of tracking nets is for a larger ship to track them later in the season and pick them up (to use less fuel).

# Summary
From April 22 to May 25, the OVI team was able to track 21 ghost nets. Conditions were not always favorable and most nets were found in becalmed conditions with beaufort scale in a range from 1 to 2, wind less than 15 knots, swell almost nonexistant. We could have gotten more nets if we had gone later in the season, when the Pacific high sets in for the season near the gyre. If I were to make this trip again, I would go later in the season and depart from the west coast of the US to save on the fuel costs and emissions it takes to depart from Hawaii (crew flying to Hawaii). 

## An Example Series of Nets Tracked from April 22 to May 1, 2021 using Adobe Illustrator.

The purpose of this series is to demonstrate the power of analysis when design is paried with data. Direction and force of wind can be found in the background; conditions and notes are used to provide more information, and pictures of nets being tagged are used for context and scale.
